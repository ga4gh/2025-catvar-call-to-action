# CIViC variant types
The [Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) database](https://civicdb.org/welcome) has structured their schema to take advantage of the categorical variation by cataloging [71 variant types](https://civicdb.org/variant-types/home) using terms from [Sequence Ontology](https://www.sequenceontology.org). This table was accessed on 2025-08-27. 

## Download data
The Variant Types table was copy and pasted from [CIViC's Variant Types](https://civicdb.org/variant-types/home) page and then manually formatted to remove additional formatting. It was then saved to [civic_variant_types.txt](./civic_variant_types.txt). 

## Count variant types
The script [sum_counts.py](./sum_counts.py) was used to count the number of variant types and the number of variants that they are associated with.
